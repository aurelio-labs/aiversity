# AIversity: An Adaptive Learning Ecosystem with Multi-Agent AI Tutoring

## Project Overview

AIversity is an innovative adaptive learning system that leverages a multi-agent AI architecture to provide personalized educational experiences. Built upon the ARCANE (Advanced Reasoning Cognitive Architecture for Networked Entities) framework, AIversity aims to revolutionize personalized education through cutting-edge AI techniques.

This project is being developed as part of an MSc program, showcasing the integration of advanced AI concepts into a practical, educational application.

## ARCANE Framework

ARCANE serves as the foundational architecture for AIversity, providing a robust platform for creating intelligent, networked entities. Key features of ARCANE include:

- Multi-agent system support
- Advanced reasoning capabilities
- Flexible communication protocols
- Integration of large language models (LLMs)

ARCANE is designed to be a versatile framework that can be applied to various AI applications beyond educational systems.

## AIversity: Adaptive Learning Ecosystem

Built on the ARCANE framework, AIversity creates a dynamic and interactive learning environment that evolves with each student's journey. 

### Key Features

- Personalized assessment and adaptive content delivery
- Dynamic task decomposition and planning
- Multi-modal learning experiences
- Collaborative multi-agent architecture for diverse expertise
- Continuous refinement of teaching methods

## Architecture Components

AIversity's architecture includes several key components:

### Iris (Intelligent Routing and Information System)

Serves as the main interface, handling user interactions, triaging requests, and coordinating activities.

### Stratos (Strategic Task and Resource Allocation Orchestration System)

Oversees task planning, resource allocation, and agent collaboration.

### Dynamic Task Agents

Specialized agents dynamically created for specific learning tasks.

### DHATN (Dynamic Hierarchical Adaptive Task Network)

A novel approach to task planning and execution, allowing for flexible and adaptive learning pathways.

## Inter-Agent Communication and Collaboration

The system employs sophisticated techniques for agent interaction, including:

- Asynchronous messaging using NIACL (Natural Interpreted Agent Communication Language)
- Shared and dynamic workspaces
- Adaptive reasoning and decision-making
- LLM-powered cognitive processing

## Project Status

AIversity is currently under active development as part of an MSc program. This is an individual project, demonstrating the application of advanced AI concepts in educational technology.
