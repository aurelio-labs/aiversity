# AIversity and ARCANE: Advanced Adaptive Learning Ecosystem

## Project Overview
This project encompasses two major components:

1. **ARCANE (Advanced Reasoning Cognitive Architecture for Networked Entities)**: A sophisticated cognitive architecture framework designed to support advanced AI systems.

2. **AIversity**: An innovative multi-agent AI tutoring system built on the ARCANE framework.

Both ARCANE and AIversity are being developed as part of an MSc program, with the goal of revolutionizing personalized education through cutting-edge AI techniques.

## ARCANE Framework
ARCANE is a comprehensive cognitive architecture that provides a robust foundation for creating intelligent, networked entities. Key features of ARCANE include:

- Multi-agent system support
- Advanced reasoning capabilities
- Flexible communication protocols
- Integration of large language models
- HERNS (Hierarchical Episodic Retrieval and Narrative Storage) memory system

ARCANE is designed to be a versatile framework that can be applied to various AI applications beyond educational systems.

## AIversity: Adaptive Learning Ecosystem
Built on the ARCANE framework, AIversity aims to create a dynamic and interactive learning environment that evolves with each student's journey. 

### Key Features
- Personalized assessment and adaptive content delivery
- Dynamic syllabus and curriculum generation
- Multi-modal learning experiences
- Collaborative multi-agent architecture for diverse expertise
- Advanced memory management through HERNS
- Continuous refinement of teaching methods

## Architecture Components
Both ARCANE and AIversity share key architectural components:

### Triage Agent
Serves as the main interface, handling requests and coordinating activities.

### Planning Agent
Oversees task planning and agent collaboration.

### Vision Agent
Processes and analyzes visual content.

### Specialized Agents
Dynamically spawned agents with specific roles (e.g., Subject Matter Experts, Content Creators).

### HERNS (Hierarchical Episodic Retrieval and Narrative Storage)
Advanced memory system enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and narrative construction.

## Inter-Agent Communication and Collaboration
The system employs sophisticated techniques for agent interaction, including:
- Asynchronous messaging
- Shared and dynamic workspaces
- State-of-Mind context adaptation
- Collision resolution for busy agents
- Progress monitoring
- HERNS-powered memory management

## Project Status
Both ARCANE and AIversity are currently under active development as part of an MSc program. This is an individual project, showcasing the integration of advanced AI concepts into a practical, educational application.

## Contributing
As this is an individual academic project, external contributions are not being accepted at this time. However, feedback and discussions are welcome.
